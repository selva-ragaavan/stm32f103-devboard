# stm32f103-devboard
This project focuses on designing a custom development board based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller by STMicroelectronics. The board integrates various essential features, including an on-board ST-Link V2 debugger, to enable easier development, flashing, and debugging without the need for external tools.
